    text: ' Working with Lincoln Park Labs has been an incredibly easy and rewarding experience. The team was able to listen to the needs we had at Concord Agriculture Partners for a carbon MRV [Monitoring Reporting and Verification] tool, and not only build a platform that met our needs, but also automate other aspects of the process we didnâ€™t even know could be taken off our plate. The expertise, creativity, and work ethic of the LPL team is unmatched in my experience with MRV and custom designed technology platforms. The carboncredify.ai platform has allowed project partners to launch two national scale carbon avoidance projects in a matter of months! \n As the projects progressed I was delighted to experience the humor, professionalism, and continued value of LPL. Not only were they able to develop a custom platform for unique global projects, but they were able to offer data services which made the project more successful through identifying gaps in field marketing. \n Overall, the team has exceeded expectations, worked diligently, and provided a quality product that has been easy for all users (even the 60+ farmers) to navigate. If you are in need of custom platform creation, MRV data management services, or data analytics services, I would recommend working with the LPL team.',
